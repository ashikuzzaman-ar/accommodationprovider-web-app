we have iplemented efficient validation system
both in front end and back-end.we have taken into consideration that 
among all of my users atleast one user can be a hacker who will try to
down my server or find the contact number of a female user.we always believe that with grest power comes great responsibility.since we r building this
for users who can also be non-techie, ensuring their experience is
flawless is our responsibilty.according to our respected SUMON AHMED sir,
setting up and following a
benchmark shuld be always a major concern.so,we will try our level
best to block the loopholes as much as we can.
